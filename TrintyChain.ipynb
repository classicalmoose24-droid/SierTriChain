        "\n",
        "**Algorithm Name:** Iterated Affine Transformation Hash (IATH)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:** Three vertex coordinates (A, B, C), where each coordinate is a tuple of two f64 values: A = (x_a, y_a), B = (x_b, y_b), C = (x_c, y_c).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:** A single 64-bit integer hash value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Normalize and Scale:**\n",
        "    *   Translate the triangle so that vertex A is at the origin (0, 0). New coordinates: A' = (0, 0), B' = (x_b - x_a, y_b - y_a), C' = (x_c - x_a, y_c - y_a).\n",
        "    *   Rotate the triangle so that the side A'B' lies along the positive x-axis. Calculate the angle $\\theta$ of A'B' with the x-axis: $\\theta = \\operatorname{atan2}(y_b - y_a, x_b - x_a)$. Apply a rotation matrix to B' and C' by $-\\theta$. New coordinates: A'' = (0, 0), B'' = (length(A'B'), 0), C'' = (x_c'', y_c'')$.\n",
        "    *   Scale the triangle so that the length of A''B'' is 1.0. The scaling factor is $s = 1.0 / \\operatorname{length}(A''B'')$. New coordinates: A''' = (0, 0), B''' = (1.0, 0.0), C''' = (x_c''' \\cdot s, y_c''' \\cdot s)$. This step provides a basic level of invariance to translation, rotation, and uniform scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Generate Affine Transformations:**\n",
        "    *   Derive a set of iterated function system (IFS) like affine transformations based on the normalized coordinates of the triangle A''', B''', and C'''. For a simple approach, we can define three transformations:\n",
        "        *   $T_1$: Maps A''' to A''', B''' to the midpoint of A'''B''', C''' to the midpoint of A'''C'''.\n",
        "        *   $T_2$: Maps A''' to the midpoint of A'''B''', B''' to B''', C''' to the midpoint of B'''C'''.\n",
        "        *   $T_3$: Maps A''' to the midpoint of A'''C''', B''' to the midpoint of B'''C''', C''' to C'''.\n",
        "    *   Each transformation $T_i$ can be represented by a 2x2 matrix and a 2x1 translation vector: $\\mathbf{v}_{new} = M_i \\mathbf{v}_{old} + \\mathbf{t}_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Iterative Mapping:**\n",
        "    *   Start with an initial point, for instance, the centroid of the normalized triangle.\n",
        "    *   Iterate a fixed number of times (e.g., 1000 iterations). In each iteration, randomly choose one of the affine transformations ($T_1, T_2, T_3$) and apply it to the current point. This process mimics the generation of a fractal attractor.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Hash Value Derivation:**\n",
        "    *   Instead of storing the points of the attractor, use the sequence of applied transformations to generate the hash. For example, if we apply $T_1$, then $T_3$, then $T_2$, the sequence is 1, 3, 2.\n",
        "    *   Convert this sequence of transformation indices into a binary or base-3 representation. For instance, using base-3, the sequence 1, 3, 2 could contribute $1 \\cdot 3^2 + 3 \\cdot 3^1 + 2 \\cdot 3^0 = 9 + 9 + 2 = 20$ to the hash.\n",
        "    *   Accumulate these values over a fixed number of iterations (e.g., the last 64 iterations to fit in a u64 hash). A more robust approach might involve a cryptographic hash function (like SHA-256) applied to the sequence of transformation indices or a summary statistic derived from the final points after a burn-in period. For this custom algorithm, let's use a simpler accumulation: take the lower bits of the transformed coordinates after a \"burn-in\" period and combine them. After a sufficient number of iterations for the point to converge towards the attractor, take the x and y coordinates of the final point. Convert the fractional parts of these coordinates into binary representations and concatenate or XOR them to form the hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How this design aims to exhibit fractal properties:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions (Vertex Coordinates):** Small changes in the initial vertex coordinates will slightly alter the normalized triangle and, consequently, the parameters of the affine transformations. Since the iterative process is highly sensitive to the exact transformations applied at each step, tiny variations in the transformation parameters due to input changes will lead to drastically different sequences of points on the attractor and thus a significantly different final hash value. This is a core characteristic of chaotic systems and fractals.\n",
        "*   **Self-Similarity in the Hash Space (Potential):** While not guaranteed in a simple accumulated hash, if a more advanced method is used (e.g., hashing the sequence of transformations), triangles that are geometrically similar (scaled, rotated, or translated versions of each other) should theoretically have related transformation sequences, potentially leading to some form of structural similarity or clustering in the hash space. However, achieving perfect self-similarity in the hash value itself is challenging and depends heavily on the hash derivation step. The normalization step provides some invariance, but the iterative process introduces complexity.\n",
        "*   **Non-linearity:** The iterative application of affine transformations is a non-linear process, contributing to the unpredictable nature of the hash output with respect to linear changes in the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "This design provides a conceptual framework. The specific choice of the number of iterations, the method for generating transformations, and the hash derivation process would need careful tuning and analysis to balance desired fractal properties with hash distribution and collision resistance."

        "## Custom Fractal Hash Algorithm Design\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the concept of fractal properties in hashing, where small changes in input lead to significant, non-linear changes in the output hash (sensitivity to initial conditions), and potentially some form of self-similarity in the hash space for geometrically similar inputs, here is a proposed design for a custom fractal hash algorithm for triangle coordinates:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Algorithm Name:** Iterated Affine Transformation Hash (IATH)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:** Three vertex coordinates (A, B, C), where each coordinate is a tuple of two f64 values: A = (x_a, y_a), B = (x_b, y_b), C = (x_c, y_c).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:** A single 64-bit integer hash value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Normalize and Scale:**\n",
        "    *   Translate the triangle so that vertex A is at the origin (0, 0). New coordinates: A' = (0, 0), B' = (x_b - x_a, y_b - y_a), C' = (x_c - x_a, y_c - y_a).\n",
        "    *   Rotate the triangle so that the side A'B' lies along the positive x-axis. Calculate the angle $\\theta$ of A'B' with the x-axis: $\\theta = \\operatorname{atan2}(y_b - y_a, x_b - x_a)$. Apply a rotation matrix to B' and C' by $-\\theta$. New coordinates: A'' = (0, 0), B'' = (length(A'B'), 0), C'' = (x_c'', y_c'')$.\n",
        "    *   Scale the triangle so that the length of A''B'' is 1.0. The scaling factor is $s = 1.0 / \\operatorname{length}(A''B'')$. New coordinates: A''' = (0, 0), B''' = (1.0, 0.0), C''' = (x_c''' \\cdot s, y_c''' \\cdot s)$. This step provides a basic level of invariance to translation, rotation, and uniform scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Generate Affine Transformations:**\n",
        "    *   Derive a set of iterated function system (IFS) like affine transformations based on the normalized coordinates of the triangle A''', B''', and C'''. For a simple approach, we can define three transformations:\n",
        "        *   $T_1$: Maps A''' to A''', B''' to the midpoint of A'''B''', C''' to the midpoint of A'''C'''.\n",
        "        *   $T_2$: Maps A''' to the midpoint of A'''B''', B''' to B''', C''' to the midpoint of B'''C'''.\n",
        "        *   $T_3$: Maps A''' to the midpoint of A'''C''', B''' to the midpoint of B'''C''', C''' to C'''.\n",
        "    *   Each transformation $T_i$ can be represented by a 2x2 matrix and a 2x1 translation vector: $\\mathbf{v}_{new} = M_i \\mathbf{v}_{old} + \\mathbf{t}_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Iterative Mapping:**\n",
        "    *   Start with an initial point, for instance, the centroid of the normalized triangle.\n",
        "    *   Iterate a fixed number of times (e.g., 1000 iterations). In each iteration, randomly choose one of the affine transformations ($T_1, T_2, T_3$) and apply it to the current point. This process mimics the generation of a fractal attractor.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Hash Value Derivation:**\n",
        "    *   Instead of storing the points of the attractor, use the sequence of applied transformations to generate the hash. For example, if we apply $T_1$, then $T_3$, then $T_2$, the sequence is 1, 3, 2.\n",
        "    *   Convert this sequence of transformation indices into a binary or base-3 representation. For instance, using base-3, the sequence 1, 3, 2 could contribute $1 \\cdot 3^2 + 3 \\cdot 3^1 + 2 \\cdot 3^0 = 9 + 9 + 2 = 20$ to the hash.\n",
        "    *   Accumulate these values over a fixed number of iterations (e.g., the last 64 iterations to fit in a u64 hash). A more robust approach might involve a cryptographic hash function (like SHA-256) applied to the sequence of transformation indices or a summary statistic derived from the final points after a burn-in period. For this custom algorithm, let's use a simpler accumulation: take the lower bits of the transformed coordinates after a \"burn-in\" period and combine them. After a sufficient number of iterations for the point to converge towards the attractor, take the x and y coordinates of the final point. Convert the fractional parts of these coordinates into binary representations and concatenate or XOR them to form the hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How this design aims to exhibit fractal properties:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions (Vertex Coordinates):** Small changes in the initial vertex coordinates will slightly alter the normalized triangle and, consequently, the parameters of the affine transformations. Since the iterative process is highly sensitive to the exact transformations applied at each step, tiny variations in the transformation parameters due to input changes will lead to drastically different sequences of points on the attractor and thus a significantly different final hash value. This is a core characteristic of chaotic systems and fractals.\n",
        "*   **Self-Similarity in the Hash Space (Potential):** While not guaranteed in a simple accumulated hash, if a more advanced method is used (e.g., hashing the sequence of transformations), triangles that are geometrically similar (scaled, rotated, or translated versions of each other) should theoretically have related transformation sequences, potentially leading to some form of structural similarity or clustering in the hash space. However, achieving perfect self-similarity in the hash value itself is challenging and depends heavily on the hash derivation step. The normalization step provides some invariance, but the iterative process introduces complexity.\n",
        "*   **Non-linearity:** The iterative application of affine transformations is a non-linear process, contributing to the unpredictable nature of the hash output with respect to linear changes in the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "This design provides a conceptual framework. The specific choice of the number of iterations, the method for generating transformations, and the hash derivation process would need careful tuning and analysis to balance desired fractal properties with hash distribution and collision resistance."

If that doesn't work, we might need to look for alternative ways to run Rust scripts or consider if the environment is fundamentally incompatible with this version of `cargo-script`. For now, let's try sourcing the environment again and re-attempting the installation, as sourcing the environment was the previous successful step.\n",

        "The installation of `cargo-script` continues to fail with the same compilation errors related to an old version of `rustc-serialize`. This indicates a fundamental incompatibility between the available version of `cargo-script` in the package registry and the current Rust toolchain in this environment. Since we cannot directly control the dependencies of `cargo-script` through `cargo install`, and attempting to force the installation didn't resolve the dependency issue, `cargo-script` cannot be used in this environment with the current setup. We need an alternative method to compile and run the Rust code written to `fractal_hash.rs`. The standard way to compile a single Rust file is using `rustc`. We can compile the `.rs` file into an executable and then run the executable. This bypasses the need for `cargo` and `cargo-script`.\n",

        "The compilation failed because the `rand` crate is not available when compiling a single file with `rustc` without a `Cargo.toml`. The error messages also indicate that `f64::consts::SQRT_3` requires an unstable feature. To fix these issues, we need to manage dependencies using Cargo. Since `cargo-script` is not working, the standard approach is to create a simple Cargo project. We can create a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src/main.rs` file, move the code there, add `rand` as a dependency, and then use `cargo run` to compile and execute the project. This is the most reliable way to handle external crates in Rust. We'll also replace `f64::consts::SQRT_3` with its numerical value to avoid the unstable feature issue.\n",

        "    *   The child triangle at vertex C uses vertices C, the midpoint of BC, and the midpoint of CA.\n",
        "*   The core subdivision logic was successfully implemented in the Rust function `subdivide_triangle` and subsequently integrated as a method named `subdivide` into the `EquilateralTriangle` struct.\n",

        "The compilation failed because the `child1`, `child2`, and `child3` variables returned by the `subdivide` method were not declared as mutable, but the state transition methods (`activate`, `mark_void`) require a mutable reference (`&mut self`). To fix this, I need to declare these variables as mutable when they are assigned the result of the `subdivide` call in the `main` function. I will modify the `main` function to add `mut` before `child1`, `child2`, and `child3`.\n",

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The `TriangleState` enum was successfully defined with `Genesis`, `Active`, `Subdivided`, and `Void` variants, including necessary derives (`Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`).\n",
        "*   A `state` field was added to the `EquilateralTriangle` struct and initialized to `TriangleState::Genesis` in the `new` constructor.\n",
        "*   State transition methods (`activate`, `mark_subdivided`, `mark_void`) were implemented, enforcing specific transitions: `Genesis` to `Active`, `Active` to `Subdivided`, and `Genesis`/`Active` to `Void`. Invalid transitions return `false`.\n",
        "*   The `subdivide` method was modified to only proceed if the triangle is in the `Active` state, returning `Some((child1, child2, child3))` on success and `None` otherwise. Upon successful subdivision, the parent triangle's state is set to `Subdivided`, and the children are created in the `Genesis` state.\n",
        "*   Unit tests were added and successfully passed, verifying both valid and invalid state transitions and subdivision attempts.\n",
        "*   Documentation comments were added to the `TriangleState` enum and relevant `EquilateralTriangle` methods, explaining the states, transitions, and validation rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The implemented state machine provides a clear and controlled way to manage the lifecycle of triangles within the fractal generation process, preventing invalid operations like subdividing a triangle that is already a void or has been subdivided.\n",
        "*   The discussion on state persistence highlights the need for a robust serialization strategy (likely using `serde` with a format like JSON or a binary option like `bincode`) to save and load fractal states for continuation or sharing.\n"

        "Now that `rust_decimal` is added as a dependency, I will modify the `EquilateralTriangle` struct to use `rust_decimal::Decimal` for its vertex coordinates instead of `f64` and update the `new` constructor accordingly. I will also update the `fractal_hash` and `subdivide` methods to use `Decimal` for coordinate calculations, including the midpoints, and remove the `area` and `is_equilateral` methods as they are not used and were generating warnings. I will also update the tests and main function to use `Decimal` for coordinates and remove the unused helper function `assert_almost_equal`.\n",

        "1. The `dec!` macro requires importing `rust_decimal_macros`. I added the `use rust_decimal_macros::dec;` statement in the previous step, but it seems it was not correctly applied or is missing the necessary dependency in `Cargo.toml`. I will add `rust_decimal_macros = \"1.35.0\"` to the `Cargo.toml`.\n",
        "2. The closures in the `transformations` array are capturing the `one_half` variable, which prevents them from being coerced into function pointers. To fix this, I need to move the `one_half` variable inside the `fractal_hash` function but define the `transformations` array outside the function or pass `one_half` as an argument to the closures. A simpler approach for this specific case is to define the scaling factor directly within the closures since it's a constant (0.5).\n",
        "3. The `to_raw_bytes` method is not a standard method on `Decimal`. To get a byte representation for hashing, I can convert the `Decimal` to a string and then get its bytes, or potentially use a different hashing approach that works directly with `Decimal` or its internal representation, although the latter might be complex. For simplicity in this example, I will convert to a string and then to bytes, acknowledging this might not be the most robust hashing for arbitrary-precision numbers.\n",

Now I need to fix the errors in `src/main.rs`: the \"cannot find macro `dec`\" errors by ensuring the macro is correctly imported and used, the \"mismatched types\" error by adjusting how the closures in `transformations` use the scaling factor, and the \"no method named `to_raw_bytes`\" error by converting the `Decimal` to a string for hashing. I will combine these fixes in the `src/main.rs` file.\n",

These criteria are essential for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the fractal structure across multiple levels of recursion.\n",

        "1.  **Equilateral Property:**\n",
        "    *   A triangle is considered equilateral if the lengths of its three sides are approximately equal.\n",
        "    *   Due to the use of `Decimal` for coordinate representation and the involvement of irrational numbers (like the square root of 3 in equilateral triangle height calculations), exact equality of side lengths might not always be achievable after multiple calculations or subdivisions.\n",

        "    *   The ideal scaling ratio of a child triangle's side length to its parent triangle's side length should be exactly 0.5.\n",

        "\n",
        "3.  **Sierpinski Relationship (for child triangles and parent):**\n",
        "    *   For a set of three triangles to be considered valid child triangles of a specific parent triangle, their vertices must align precisely with the parent's vertices and midpoints as per the Sierpinski subdivision rule.\n",
        "    *   Let the parent triangle have vertices P_A, P_B, and P_C.\n",
        "    *   Let the midpoints of the parent's sides be M_AB (midpoint of P_A and P_B), M_BC (midpoint of P_B and P_C), and M_CA (midpoint of P_C and P_A).\n",
        "    *   The three valid child triangles should have vertices corresponding to:\n",

        "    *   Validation involves checking if the vertex coordinates of the child triangles match the calculated vertex and midpoint coordinates of the parent triangle within a defined tolerance. The order of vertices within a child triangle might need to be considered depending on how equality is checked, but for this definition, the set of vertices should match.\n",

        "Now that the `itertools` dependency is added, I will implement the `validate_sierpinski_relationship` method in the `EquilateralTriangle` struct. This method will calculate the expected midpoints of the parent triangle and then check if the vertices of the given child triangles match the expected vertex combinations (parent vertex and two midpoints) within a defined tolerance. This involves iterating through the child triangles and checking if their vertices correspond to any of the three expected child configurations, considering permutations of child vertices. I will also add documentation for this new method and update the test module with a new test case for this validation.\n",
